# ----------------------
# Without running it, can you see whatâ€™s wrong with this piece of a program?
#

# The curly braces that enclose the hash lists are actually creating an 
# anonymous hash reference. This reference is returned, and we are attempting
# to assign it to a hash. THAT won't work!
