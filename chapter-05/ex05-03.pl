# Chapter 05 Exercise 03
# ----------------------
# Starting with your data structure from Exercise 2, rewrite the 
# coconet.dat file so that itâ€™s in the same format, but sorted by source 
# machine. Report each destination machine once per source machine along 
# with total bytes transferred. The destination machines should be 
# indented under the source machine name and be sorted by the machine name.

	# split the line into its constituent parts.
	my ($source, $destination, $bytes) = split;

	# add to the total for source / destination pair.
	$total_bytes{$source}{$destination} += $bytes;

	# add to overall total for source.
	$all_sources{$source} += $bytes;
