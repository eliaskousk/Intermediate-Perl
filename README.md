# Intermediate-Perl
Going through the "Intermediate Perl" book, one chapter at a time.

The objectives of this exercise are as follows:

+ Continue to improve my perl skills. Having completed [Learning Perl](https://github.com/ruddystream/Learning-Perl), I now want to boost my skills to the point that I can realize the applications I have in my head.
+ Publish to CPAN. I have a couple of ideas that others might find useful, so this will lead to me being able to do that.

Feel free to follow along, poke fun, etc!
